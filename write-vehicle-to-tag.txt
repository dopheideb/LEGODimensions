Android:
* Enable NFC. Make sure that you allow to both read and write to a tag.
* Install app "NFC Tools" by author "wakdev".
* Open the app.
* The app should open on the "READ" tab. If not, switch to it.
* Hold the tag in range of your NFC reader. The NFS reader is often 
  located in the back side of your phone, somewhere in the middle.
* Write down the serial number. In my case 04:D9:C8:DA:A2:40:80.
* Note that this is 7 byte UID/serial, not an 8 byte UID.
* Remove all colons from the serial. In my case: 04D9C8DAA24080.
* Inside app "NFC Tools", go to tab "OTHER" and tap "Advanced NFC 
  commands".
* You will get a disclaimer/notice. You decide whether to "cancel" or to 
  "understand".
* Test whether you can read the tag with these advanced commands. Do 
  this by entering the following command: 30 00. This will read the 
  first 16 bytes of the tag, containing, amongst other stuff, the serial 
  of the tag.
* Optionally: Try to read the protected page. Do this by entering the 
  following command: 30 24
* If the tag is password protected, you will get "Error: I/O failure". 
  If the tag is new/fresh, you should get data, probably 4 times the 
  zero bytes.
* Compute the password for the serial of the tag. In my case: 519101d0.
* Test whether the generated password is correct by entering the 
  following command: 1B 519101d0,3024
  "1B"      : command/opcode to do password authentication
  "519101d0": the password for this tag.
  ","       : command separator in app "NFC Tools"
  "30"      : Command/opcode for reading 16 bytes.
  "24"      : Read those 16 bytes starting at page 0x24 (offset 144).
* Lookup the ID of the vehicle. In my case, I wanted another Batmobile, 
  so my ID is 0x03EE (1006).
* Note: with generic LEGO NFC tags, one can only store a vehicle on such 
  a tag. The tag is write protected against changing from vehicle to 
  character.
* Write to the appropriate pages. Do this by entering the following 
  command:
    Write the ID as little Endian dword:
      1B 519101d0,A2 24 ee030000
    
    Write the upgrades (no upgrades in our case):
      1B 519101d0,A2 25 00000000
